## 🚀 Getting Started

### Frontend (React)

1. Open terminal in the `frontend` folder:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
cd frontend
>>>>>>> 8c690be (Updated UI)
Install dependencies:

"""
npm install
Start the development server:
""
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Backend (Spring Boot / Eclipse)
Open Eclipse IDE and import the backend folder as an existing Maven project.

Configure MySQL database in application.properties:

properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/farmxchain
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
Create the database:

CREATE DATABASE farmxchain;
Run FarmxchainAuthApplication.java as a Java Application. The backend will start on http://localhost:8082.

🔄 Running the Full Application
Start MySQL.

Run the backend in Eclipse.

Run the frontend (npm start).

Access the app at http://localhost:3000.
The frontend communicates with backend APIs at http://localhost:8082.



💡 Notes
Ensure ports 3000 (frontend) and 8082 (backend) are free.
